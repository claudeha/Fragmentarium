Fragmentarium is a cross-platform application for exploring pixel based graphics on the GPU.

Features:

* Multi-tabbed IDE, with GLSL syntax highlighting
* User widgets to manipulate parameter settings.
* Different 'mouse to GLSL' mapping schemes
* Modular GLSL programming - include other fragments
* Includes simple raytracer for distance estimated systems
* Many examples including Mandelbulb, Mandelbox, Kaleidoscopic IFS, and Julia Quaternion.   

Fragmentarium is built in C++, OpenGL/GLSL, and Qt 5.
